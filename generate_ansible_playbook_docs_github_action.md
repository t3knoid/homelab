# ⚙️ GitHub Action: Generate Playbook Docs

## 📖 Purpose

This workflow ensures that documentation for all Ansible roles is **automatically generated and kept up to date**. Whenever code is pushed or a pull request is opened, the workflow runs the `generate_role_docs.py` script, which regenerates per‑playbook README.md files, builds folder‑level summaries, and maintains a global index of playbooks.

## 🔑 Key Points

- **Trigger:** Runs on every push to `main` and on pull requests.  
- **Checkout:** Uses `actions/checkout@v4` with `fetch-depth: 0` so commits can be pushed back.  
- **Python Setup:** Uses Python 3.11 (adjustable).  
- **Dependencies:** Installs from `requirements.txt` (currently only PyYAML).  
- **Script Execution:** Runs `scripts/generate_playbook_docs.py` to regenerate playbook documentation.  
- **Commit Logic:**  
  - Stages only playbook READMEs and the global index.  
  - Commits only if changes exist (`git diff --cached --quiet` prevents empty commits).  
  - Pushes back to the branch that triggered the workflow.  
- **Permissions:** Requires repository **Actions → Workflow permissions** set to **Read and write** so the built‑in `GITHUB_TOKEN` can push commits.
