# ⚙️ GitHub Action: Generate Ansible Role Docs

## 📖 Purpose
This workflow ensures that documentation for all Ansible roles is **automatically generated and kept up to date**.  
Whenever code is pushed or a pull request is opened, the workflow runs the [Generate Role Documentation Script](generate_role_documentation_script.md), which regenerates each role’s `README.md`, and updates the central `roles/README.md` index. If changes are detected, they are committed back to the repository.

## 📝 Summary

* **Trigger:** Runs on every push to `main` and on pull requests.  
* **Checkout:** Uses `actions/checkout@v4` with `fetch-depth: 0` so commits can be pushed back.  
* **Python Setup:** Uses Python 3.11 (adjustable).  
* **Dependencies:** Installs from `requirements.txt` (currently only PyYAML).  
* **Script Execution:** Runs `scripts/generate_role_docs.py` to regenerate role documentation.
* **Generated Documentation:** The following markdown files are created by the Python script:
  * `roles/README.md`
  * `docs/roles/README.md`
  * `docs/roles/<role folder name>.md`
* **Commit Logic:**  
  * Stages only role READMEs and the central index.  
  * Commits only if changes exist (`git diff --cached --quiet` prevents empty commits).  
  * Pushes back to the branch that triggered the workflow.  
* **Permissions:** Requires repository **Actions → Workflow permissions** set to **Read and write** so the built‑in `GITHUB_TOKEN` can push commits.
