# Provision a Virtual Machine Runbook

This runbook explains how to provision a new virtual machine with `playbooks/provision_vm.yml` and what minimum inventory data must exist for the workflow to succeed.

The provisioning workflow creates a new virtual machine, installs Python so Ansible can manage it, joins the VM to Active Directory, applies the baseline configuration for Ansible nodes, provisions users, and prepares any additional disks for use. The result is a fully initialized, domain-joined, Ansible-ready VM with the expected hardware, networking, users, and storage.

For baremetal hosts, this playbook does not create the machine. It only runs the post-creation stages such as Python bootstrap, domain join, node preparation, user management, and disk preparation.

To install an operating system onto a baremetal machine in this repository, use the PXE workflow first, then run `playbooks/provision_vm.yml` after the operating system has been installed.

## 1. Login to an Ansible Control Node

Start on a control node with Ansible installed and activate the expected Python environment.

{% raw %}
```shell
cd ~/ansible
source /opt/python_3.12/bin/activate
INV=inventory/test/inventory.ini
```
{% endraw %}

Important:

- Run this workflow from an Ansible control node.
- Make sure the control node can reach both Proxmox and the target network.

## 2. Pull the Latest Code

Update the local repository before making or deploying changes.

{% raw %}
```shell
git pull origin main
```
{% endraw %}

Important:

- Pull first so inventory and role changes are based on the latest repository state.

## 2A. Baremetal OS Provisioning Uses PXE First

Baremetal operating system installation is not handled directly by `playbooks/provision_vm.yml`.

The actual OS provisioning path for baremetal is:

1. Deploy the PXE server with `playbooks/pxe/deploy_pxe.yml`.
2. Configure a specific baremetal client for netboot with `playbooks/pxe/configure_pxe.yml`.
3. Boot the physical host from the network so Ubuntu autoinstall runs.
4. After the OS installation completes, run `playbooks/provision_vm.yml` to perform the post-install configuration steps.

Repository behavior:

- `playbooks/pxe/deploy_pxe.yml` installs and configures the PXE server on hosts in the `pxe` group.
- `playbooks/pxe/configure_pxe.yml` renders client-specific DHCP, PXE, and autoinstall configuration for hosts in the `pxe_client` group.
- `playbooks/provision_vm.yml` then handles Python bootstrap, domain join, baseline node prep, users, and disks after the OS already exists on the host.

## 3. Define the Host and Related Properties

Provisioning a new VM requires updates in three places.

### A. Define the host in the inventory

Edit the target inventory file, for example:

{% raw %}
```text
inventory/test/inventory.ini
```
{% endraw %}

At minimum, define the host in these groups:

- `vms`
- `python`

Recommended:

- `linux`

Example:

{% raw %}
```ini
[vms]
test-01 vms_proxmox_node=pve-1 vms_clone=false

[linux]
test-01

[python]
test-01
```
{% endraw %}

Pay special attention to these `[vms]` host variables:

- `vms_proxmox_node`: controls which Proxmox node will host the VM and where the provisioning tasks will target VM operations such as creation, cloud-init updates, start, stop, and reboot.
- `vms_clone`: deprecated and currently ignored by the `vms` role.

Why these groups matter:

- `vms` makes the VM creation stage run.
- `python` makes the Python bootstrap stage run.
- `linux` is not required by `playbooks/provision_vm.yml` itself, but it matches the normal inventory pattern used in this repository.

### B. Define the host IP address in global vars

Edit:

{% raw %}
```text
roles/global/vars/main.yml
```
{% endraw %}

Add the host to `global_ip_addresses`:

{% raw %}
```yaml
global_ip_addresses:
  test-01: 192.168.2.210
```
{% endraw %}

This is a critical prerequisite.

The provisioning workflow derives `global_ip_address` from that mapping, and the VM provisioning role uses it for cloud-init networking, DNS updates, and related host setup. If the hostname is missing from `global_ip_addresses`, the machine will not be provisioned correctly.

### C. Define VM hardware and OS configuration

Create or edit a host-specific vars file, for example:

{% raw %}
```text
inventory/test/host_vars/test-01.yml
```
{% endraw %}

The minimum required variables for a VM are:

- `vms_config`
- `vms_os`
- `python3_version`

Example:

{% raw %}
```yaml
vms_config:
  agent: "1"
  cores: "2"
  cpu: host
  memory: 1024
  ostype: l26
  scsihw: virtio-scsi-single
  sockets: 1
  storage: local
  disk_os:
    disk: virtio0
    backup: true
    size: 20
    storage: local
    format: qcow2
  nic0:
    model: virtio
    bridge: vmbr0
    tag: 20
  boot_order: "order=virtio0"
  disk2:
    disk: virtio1
    storage: local-lvm
    size: 20

vms_os: ubuntu_24_server
vms_autoinstall: true
vms_enable_serial_terminal: false
vms_additional_packages: []
python3_version: 3.12
```
{% endraw %}

If you prefer to share values across all hosts in an inventory, you can place them in `group_vars/all/main.yml` instead of `host_vars/<host>.yml`. The key requirement is that the host resolves these variables at runtime.

### C2. Define baremetal PXE configuration

To provision an operating system onto a baremetal host, define the host in an inventory that includes these groups at minimum:

- `baremetal`
- `python`
- `pxe_client`

You also need at least one host in the `pxe` group, because `pxeserver_setup` defaults to using `groups['pxe'][0]` as the PXE server.

A real example exists in `inventory/dns/inventory.ini`:

{% raw %}
```ini
[baremetal]
dns-1

[python]
dns-1

[pxe_client]
dns-1

[pxe]
pxe-0
```
{% endraw %}

Minimum baremetal PXE variables:

- `vms_os`
- `python3_version`
- `pxeserver_setup_client_nic`
- `pxeserver_setup_dhcp_range`
- `pxeserver_setup_ip_reservations`
- a `global_ip_addresses` entry for both the PXE server host and the baremetal client

Example client-specific configuration:

{% raw %}
```yaml
vms_os: ubuntu_24_server
python3_version: 3.12
pxeserver_setup_client_nic: "enp2s0"
pxeserver_setup_dhcp_range: "192.168.2.253,192.168.2.253,255.255.255.0"
pxeserver_setup_ip_reservations:
  - { mac_address: '0C:C4:7A:E2:83:5A', ip_address: '192.168.2.253' }
```
{% endraw %}

What these variables control:

- `vms_os`: selects the Ubuntu release artifacts used by the PXE role, including the ISO URL and autoinstall source content.
- `pxeserver_setup_client_nic`: selects the interface name that the installed operating system should configure.
- `pxeserver_setup_dhcp_range`: defines the DHCP lease range that dnsmasq will hand out during PXE boot. In the current repo pattern this is usually a single IP.
- `pxeserver_setup_ip_reservations`: binds the target machine's MAC address to the intended installation IP.

Operational note:

- The PXE role metadata explicitly notes that under TP-Link Omada, the "Legal DHCP Servers" setting must allow the PXE server IP.

### D. `vms_config` parameter reference

Pay special attention to these settings:

- `vms_config.ostype` controls the Proxmox OS type and should align with `vms_os` so the VM definition matches the operating system being installed.
- `vms_config.disk_os.storage` controls the physical storage location of the boot disk.
- `vms_config.network.nic0.tag` controls the VLAN placement of the VM's primary network interface.

## 4. Commit Configuration Changes

After editing the inventory and global vars, commit the changes.

{% raw %}
```shell
git add inventory/test/
git add roles/global/vars/main.yml
git commit -m "Provision new VM test-01 with defined hardware and IP"
git push origin main
```
{% endraw %}

Important:

- Replace `test-01` with the real VM name.
- Commit inventory and IP mapping changes together so the repository history reflects the full provisioning request.

## 5. Deploy Using the Provisioning Playbook

Run the provisioning workflow:

{% raw %}
```shell
ansible-playbook -i $INV playbooks/provision_vm.yml -k
```
{% endraw %}

Notes:

- Use `-k` if SSH password prompting is required.
- Use `--limit <hostname>` if you only want to act on a single host in a larger inventory.

Example:

{% raw %}
```shell
ansible-playbook -i inventory/loki/inventory.ini playbooks/provision_vm.yml --limit loki-0 -k
```
{% endraw %}

### Baremetal PXE install sequence

For baremetal, the command sequence is different because the OS must be installed before `playbooks/provision_vm.yml` can do the post-install work.

1. Deploy or refresh the PXE server:

{% raw %}
```shell
ansible-playbook -i $INV playbooks/pxe/deploy_pxe.yml -k
```
{% endraw %}

1. Configure the target baremetal client for PXE boot:

{% raw %}
```shell
ansible-playbook -i $INV playbooks/pxe/configure_pxe.yml --limit <baremetal-host> -k
```
{% endraw %}

1. Boot the physical machine from the network and let Ubuntu autoinstall complete.
2. After the machine finishes installing and is reachable by SSH, run the post-install workflow:

{% raw %}
```shell
ansible-playbook -i $INV playbooks/provision_vm.yml --limit <baremetal-host> -k
```
{% endraw %}

## 6. Verify Deployment

After the playbook completes:

1. Log into Proxmox.
2. Confirm the VM exists.
3. Confirm the VM is powered on.
4. Confirm the CPU, memory, disks, and NIC configuration match the requested values.
5. Confirm the assigned IP matches the entry in `global_ip_addresses`.
6. If autoinstall is enabled, confirm the operating system installation completes successfully.
7. Confirm the machine is joined to the domain and is reachable for follow-up Ansible runs.

## What `playbooks/provision_vm.yml` Calls

The top-level playbook is an orchestration wrapper around six imported playbooks.

### 1. `playbooks/vms/provision_vm.yml`

This stage creates the virtual machine.

What it does:

- targets the `vms` group
- applies the `global` role
- refreshes local DNS entries through Pi-hole tasks
- provisions through either Terraform-backed or Ansible-native VM tasks depending on `vms_use_terraform`

### 2. `playbooks/python/bootstrap_python3.yml`

This stage installs Python so Ansible can manage the host with normal modules.

What it does:

- targets the `python` group
- runs the `python3` role bootstrap tasks

### 3. `playbooks/ad/join_domain.yml`

This stage joins the host to Active Directory.

What it does:

- targets `vms`, `baremetal`, and `wsl`
- applies the `global` role
- imports the `ad` role

### 4. `playbooks/ansible/prep_ansible_node.yml`

This stage applies the repository baseline for managed nodes.

What it does:

- targets `vms`, `baremetal`, and `wsl`
- applies the `global` role
- applies the `ansible_node` role

### 5. `playbooks/vms/add_users.yml`

This stage provisions the standard users.

What it does:

- targets `vms` and `baremetal`
- applies the `global` role
- applies the `users` role

### 6. `playbooks/vms/prep_disk.yml`

This stage prepares additional local disks.

What it does:

- targets `vms` and `baremetal`
- applies the `disks` role
- formats and mounts extra disks declared through inventory variables such as `disk2` and `disks_disk_mounts`

## PXE Playbooks for Baremetal OS Installation

### `playbooks/pxe/deploy_pxe.yml`

This playbook deploys the PXE server on hosts in the `pxe` group.

What it does:

- applies the `global` role
- applies `nginx_setup`
- applies `pxeserver_setup`
- installs dnsmasq, syslinux, and supporting files
- downloads the Ubuntu netboot tarball and live server ISO into the PXE server's TFTP/HTTP root

### `playbooks/pxe/configure_pxe.yml`

This playbook configures a specific PXE client host in the `pxe_client` group.

What it does:

- imports `pxeserver_setup` tasks from `configure.yml`
- rewrites dnsmasq configuration for the PXE server
- adds or updates DHCP MAC reservations for the target client
- renders `user-data` and `meta-data` for Ubuntu autoinstall
- renders `pxelinux.cfg/default` with the PXE boot parameters

The PXE boot configuration ultimately passes these important kernel parameters:

- `iso-url={{ pxeserver_setup_iso_url }}`
- `autoinstall`
- `ds=nocloud-net;s=http://{{ pxeserver_setup_ip }}`

That means the installer boots over PXE, downloads the Ubuntu ISO from the PXE server over HTTP, and pulls its autoinstall configuration from the same PXE server.

## Minimum Requirements Summary

For a new VM, the minimum repository changes are:

1. Add the host to `inventory/<name>/inventory.ini` under `vms` and `python`.
2. Add the host IP to `roles/global/vars/main.yml` under `global_ip_addresses`.
3. Define `vms_config`, `vms_os`, and `python3_version` for the host.

For baremetal preparation with the same playbook, the machine must already exist and the minimum inventory contract is:

1. Add the host to `inventory/<name>/inventory.ini` under `baremetal` and `python`.
2. Add the host IP to `roles/global/vars/main.yml` under `global_ip_addresses`.
3. Define `python3_version` and any role-specific variables needed by `ad`, `ansible_node`, `users`, or `disks`.

For baremetal OS installation via PXE, the minimum repository changes are:

1. Add the target host to `inventory/<name>/inventory.ini` under `baremetal`, `python`, and `pxe_client`.
2. Ensure a PXE server host exists in the same inventory under `pxe`.
3. Add the host IP to `roles/global/vars/main.yml` under `global_ip_addresses`.
4. Define `vms_os`, `python3_version`, `pxeserver_setup_client_nic`, `pxeserver_setup_dhcp_range`, and `pxeserver_setup_ip_reservations` for the baremetal client.
5. Run `playbooks/pxe/deploy_pxe.yml`, then `playbooks/pxe/configure_pxe.yml`, then network-boot the host, and finally run `playbooks/provision_vm.yml`.

## Notes

- Always double-check the hostname, IP address, storage target, VLAN tag, and requested hardware before deploying.
- Use the same workflow for both new VM provisioning and later hardware updates.
- Pulling first, committing the inventory change, and then deploying keeps the repository state consistent.
- The control node must have network access to the Proxmox cluster and to the target environment.
- For baremetal PXE installs, verify the target machine firmware is configured for PXE/network boot and that its MAC address matches the reservation configured in `pxeserver_setup_ip_reservations`.
