# Trigger Semaphore Setup Workflow

## 📖 Purpose

This workflow ensures that the **Setup Semaphore** task inside the **Home Lab** project in Semaphore UI is automatically executed whenever relevant inventory changes are committed. Instead of running the `setup_semaphoreui.yml` playbook locally, this workflow delegates execution to Semaphore, keeping configuration application centralized, consistent, and environment‑controlled.

Whenever files under `inventory/semaphore/group_vars/semaphore/` are modified, the workflow runs the reusable [scripts/semaphore_trigger.py](https://github.com/t3knoid/ansible/tree/main/scripts/execute_semaphoreui_setup.py] script, which authenticates with Semaphore UI, locates the correct project and task template, and triggers a new execution.

## 🔑 Key Points

- **Trigger:** Runs automatically whenever any file under  
  `inventory/semaphore/group_vars/semaphore/`  
  is added, modified, or removed.  
- **Checkout:** Uses `actions/checkout@v4` to pull the repository contents.  
- **Python Setup:** Uses Python 3.12 to run the API‑driven trigger script.  
- **Dependencies:** Installs only the `requests` library (lightweight and fast).  
- **Script Execution:**  
  - Calls `scripts/semaphore_trigger.py`, which:  
    - Authenticates with Semaphore UI  
    - Locates the **Home Lab** project  
    - Locates the **Setup Semaphore** task template  
    - Executes the template  
    - Prints the execution ID and monitoring URL  
- **Secrets:** Requires a repository secret named `SEMAPHORE_API_TOKEN`.  
- **Design Intent:** Keeps GitHub Actions lightweight while delegating configuration application to Semaphore, ensuring consistent execution environments and centralized automation.
